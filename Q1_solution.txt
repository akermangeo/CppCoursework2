25u is an unsigned integer.
50 is an intger, but get converted to an unsigned interger as the two operands 
are different types and the unsigned integer type is higher in the higherarchy 
than a standard intger.

So the opperation becomes

25u - 50u = 4294967271

because the maximum size of an unsigned intger is 4294967295.  So when 50 is 
subtraced from 25 the value rolls over and ends up as 4294967295 - 24.
